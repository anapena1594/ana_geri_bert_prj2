Title:GUI_ImageManipulation.py

Author:Ana Pena,Humberto Plaza, Yeraldiny Jose Alonzo

Abstract:This programs utilize buttons and filters to create a gui that initialize the buttons for three different filters.
         Each button grabs the code and make the picture take the filter chosen by the user,
         displaying it on a different window. The program runs with pictures from a desktop directory, if the user would like to use it 
         in a different computer he/she would need to enter the path of each picture into the image.open path.
